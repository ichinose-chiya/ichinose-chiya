### Hello from Ichinose Chiya~ üëã

- I'm currently a university student majoring Computer Science in my sophomore year.
- I'm currently learning about `Binary Security`, especially the `Reverse Engineering`. Looking forward to learn to `Pwn` in the future...
- I'm currently an inexperienced individual CTF player, looking forward to joining or creating a team.
- I'm currently using [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/) as my daily OS along with the Windows. Rolling to keep update together with the convenience is what I need indeed.
- You can contact with me across the mail: [ichinosechiya@gmail.com](mailto:ichinosechiya@gmail.com)
